I am Taslima Akter, a fifth year computer science Ph.D. student at Indiana University. My current research interest lies in the field of usable privacy and security in the context of assistive technologies; in particular I am excited about understanding and designing systems that can address privacy challenges faced by people with visual impairments while using existing and emerging assistive technologies.

## Things going on

- Designing a privacy-enhanced assistive system for people with visual impairments.
- Iâ€™m currently looking for internship opportunities for summer 2021!
